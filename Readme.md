### Connecting Ganache with Remix
- First we have to download ganahche in our system (You can download it from here https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/)
- Then we have to compile our smart contract 
- After compiling we have to deploy our smart contract with ganache provider
- Then we have to open our ganache network and copy the RPC URl from there and paste it in remix
- Our smart contract have been deployed with ganache( Note:- Keep your ganache app open in the background)
