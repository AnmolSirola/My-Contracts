# How To Start Blockchain

Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Blockchain is a type of shared database that differs from a typical database in the way that it stores information; blockchains store data in blocks that are then linked together via cryptography. As new data comes in, it is entered into a fresh block. Once the block is filled with data, it is chained onto the previous block, which makes the data chained together in chronological order.

### Pre-requisite Skills Required to learn Blockchain :-

1) Programming Language :- Having knowlegde of programming languages like Java, C++ and C  etc , will help you learn and understand the programming language used in development of blockchain. If you already know a programming language it will be easier for you to learn new language for blockchain and you will grasp the fundamentals more clearly and fast.

2) Object-Oriented Programming :- Object-oriented programming (OOPs) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. Oops reduce development time because you can reuse code and develop models based on previous objects, allows u to write clean code and gives an effective problem solving.

3) Front-End Development :- Web3 is based on web2 only , the front-end part remains the same only the backend changes . We need a front-end to interact the backend of our dapp (decentrailsed application ) or website. So basically we should have knowlegde of html css and javascipt for it .

4) Framework :- It is not mandatory but it is good to know a framework like React.js, Next.js or Angular.js . As these framework allow us to improve the UI and apprearenace of our website.

### Web3 TechStack :-

1) Selecting the **Chain** you are working on :- There are many blockchains, the two most famous and in demand are **Ethereum** and **Solana**. According to many stats
ethereum has more market cap and has bigger developer community, so here we will be talking about Solidity only.

2) Writing **Smart Contracts**:- We need to know about **Solidity** to learn ethereum development as it is one of the most important and famous programming language. Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. With the help of Solidity we will be able to write smart contracts which is the backend of our program.

- **Openzeppelin**

3) Testing and Installing Dependencies:- Before we deploy our smart contracts to the mainnet we need to test them, we can test them with the help of **javascript** . To be specific we can use javascript test framework like **mocha** and **chai** . Also we need knowlegde of **node.js** which helps in our project as Javascript Backend for **Dependencies**.

4) Using Metamask:-

5) Contract Framework:- We need an framework for Compiling, Testing and to Deploy our contracts on any IDE. The most two popular contract framework are:-
- **HardHat**:- It's a flexible and extensible task runner that helps you manage and automate the recurring tasks inherent to developing smart contracts and dApps. It also helps 
- **Truffle**:-

6) JavaScript libraries that enable frontend apps to interacttion :- sadsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ðŸ‘Ž
- **Ether.js**:-
- **Web3.js**:-

7) React.js (Javascript Framework for Frontend Dapps)- 



8)  Moralis (APIs, Indexing, Boilerplates, Best Documentation Hands Down)
